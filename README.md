# Mirror of the ACME crossassembler repository

The [ACME crossassembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/) 
is developed using a subversion repository. This repository is a mirror 
maintained for my own purposes.

## Compilation

Just type `make` or `gmake` (on BSD) from the `src` directory.
The Makefile expects `gcc` to be the GNU CC compiler.
